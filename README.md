# My Python Modules

- Linear Data Structures (LinearStructures)
    1. Doubly Linked Lists (LinkedList)
        - No support for circular linked lists yet
    2. Stacks (Stack)
    3. Deques (Deque)
- Tree Data Structures (Trees)
    1. Binary Trees (BinarySearchTree)a
        - Still subjected to testing
- Text Search Algorithms (TextSearch)
    1. Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm (kmp)
    2. Simple Text Search (sts)
    3. Python Built-in Text Search (pys)
- Random Solutions (MiscSolutions)
    1. Print first n Fibonacci numbers (fib)
        - O(n)
        - No iterative loops
        - No nested functions
    2. Print even numbers from a list (print_even)
        - O(n)
        - No iterative loops
        - No nested functions
- Maximum Difference in Array (HackerRank)
    - Given an array of integers, a, find the maximum difference between
    two elements, a[i] and a[j], given the following conditions below:
        1. i < j
        2. a[j] - a[i] > 0
    - Return -1 if there is no such maximum difference.
